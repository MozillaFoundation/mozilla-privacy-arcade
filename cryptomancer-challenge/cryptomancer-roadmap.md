# Cryptomancer Challenge Roadmap

- **May, 2017:** Request a DRM-free copy of Cryptomancer from a project lead. Cryptomancer is kindly provided free-of-charge for the Global Sprint by the game’s authors. If you live in a place with a lot of local makerspaces and/or interest in this project, consider organizing a meet-up from 9-5, local time, each day of the sprint for face-to-face work.
- **May 31, 2017:** Finish reading Cryptomancer and post questions about the game to Mozilla Privacy Arcade repo.
- **June 1-2, 2017:** During the sprint, brainstorm, draft, and playtest Cryptomancer adventures that incorporate teaching and learning about privacy and security and related Internet health issues like digital inclusion.
- **June, 2017:** Project leads curate and share exemplar projects online.
- **Summer, 2017:** Contributors playtest one another’s adventures at local game stores (LGS).
- **Summer, 2017:** Project leads help interested community members submit their adventures as sessions for the Privacy & Security space at this year’s MozFest.
- **Summer 2017:** Project leads publish a special Mozilla-curated issue of Code & Dagger, Cryptomancer’s publication for adventures, expansions, and other supplemental game material, that features exemplar adventures.
- **October 27-29, 2017:** MozFest. Project contributors who cannot attend might plan to run their adventure during the festival as part of a “Cryptomancer Day” or MozFest Fringe Event.
