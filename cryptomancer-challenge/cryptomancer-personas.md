# Cryptomancer Challenge Personas

A persona is

- An imaginary user.
- Based on observations or understandings of actual potential or current users.
- Detailed enough so it feels real to the designer, so they can imagine the persona’s needs and responses to a product or project.

Think of what brings you to this project and drives you to contribute. Look for allies and potential project recruits like these who might join you!

***Briana is a crypto expert and table-top gamer*** who just found out about Cryptomancer. In talking with her friends, she often finds it difficult to explain complicated privacy and safety issues in simple ways that preserve the complexity of things like data-mining, encryption, and surveillance. She discovers the Global Sprint and Cryptomancer challenge in a forwarded email chain from a professional list. She decides to read the game and gets inspired by it to join the Global Sprint and create an adventure for her local game group that will help them understand her work and the privacy and security issues they face every day whether they know it or not. Briana does not have a lot of questions about the project, but she answers community members’ questions about cryptography and encryption in the project’s issue tracker.

***Hermán is a longtime Mozilla volunteer and technology evangelist.*** He finds out about the Global Sprint from a Mozilla blogpost. While skimming projects, he finds the Cryptomancer Challenge. Hermán is not a big gamer, but Cryptomancer sounds really cool to him. He reads the game in May and decides to invite a few close friends and fellow Mozillians to a meetup where they write an adventure together with their favorite characters from pop media and local culture. Hermán would love to produce something that would make for a good MozFest session proposal later on and asks lots of questions on the project’s issue tracker.

***Akela writes homebrew RPGs that empower her and her friends.*** She knows about Cryptomancer from Reddit boards, but has never played the game. She sees a Global Sprint and Cryptomancer Challenge post on Reddit and checks it out. While she doesn’t know if she wants to write and adventure or not, she lurks and reads other contributors’ work. She asks questions about representation and identity through the project’s issue tracker and helps other contributors improve their work and better align it with Internet health issues like digital inclusion.
