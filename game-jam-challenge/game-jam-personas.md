# Game Jam Challenge Personas

A persona is

- An imaginary user.
- Based on observations or understandings of actual potential or current users.
- Detailed enough so it feels real to the designer, so they can imagine the persona’s needs and responses to a product or project.

Think of what brings you to this project and drives you to contribute. Look for allies and potential project recruits like these who might join you!

***Lita is a app developer and local Mozilla Club Captain*** who wants to find new ways to teach her learners about privacy and security. Lita discovers the Global Sprint through a clubs blog post and she discovers the Game Jam Challenge by skimming his year’s projects. She organizes a meet up at her local tech space to hack on privacy and security games during the Global Sprint. She invites several club members who are ready to contribute to the Game Jam challenge and meet the larger tech community in her city.

***Miya is a designer who works for a non-profit activist organization*** that teaches vulnerable community members how to safeguard their data and identities online. She discovers the Global Sprint and Game Jam challenge through a note sent out by her organization’s director who is an ally of Mozilla. Miya finds a local meetup supporting the sprint and goes there with a few colleagues to see if they can find developers who will help them sprint on some of the characters and ideas they’ve incorporated into the face-to-face instructional materials and publications. Miya would love to propose a MozFest session about pathways people can take in transitioning advocacy and storytelling work from static print to interactive media.

***Cy is a project manager at a game development studio*** who discovers the Global Sprint and Game Jam Challenge through an email forwarded by one of her colleagues as a piece of personal outreach. Cy emails her team about the sprint and works to organize a small group of colleagues to participate, securing time for them to prototype a privacy and security game during work hours.
