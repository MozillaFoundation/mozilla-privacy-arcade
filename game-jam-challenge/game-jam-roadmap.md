# Game Jam Challenge Roadmap

- **May, 2017:** Assemble teammates and resources for the game jam challenge. If you live in a place with a lot of local makerspaces and/or interest in this project, consider organizing a meet-up from 9-5, local time, each day of the sprint for face-to-face work.
- **May 31, 2017:** Finish assembling teams and collecting resources ahead of the game jam challenge.
- **June 1-2, 2017:** During the sprint, brainstorm, prototype, and playtest web-native privacy and security games that incorporate teaching and learning about privacy and security and related Internet health issues like digital inclusion.
- **June, 2017:** Project leads curate and share exemplar games online.
- **Summer, 2017:** Contributors playtest one another’s games  and help them improve.
- **Summer, 2017:** Project leads help interested community members submit their games as sessions for the Privacy & Security space at this year’s MozFest.
- **October 25-26, 2017:** Representatives projects that have been accepted as part of MozFest polish their games during MozFest pre-week in London, England.
- **October 27-29, 2017:** MozFest. Project contributors who cannot attend might plan a game jam to hack on their games or create new ones during the festival as part of a privacy and security game jam or MozFest Fringe Event.
